                                Marissa Mayer led the development of Google's most successful products for more than 10 years and was appointed CEO of Yahoo in 2012, at the age of 37.
                                Although she grew up thinking she would be a doctor, while at Stanford University, Mayer developed a passion for computers and went on to earn both a Bachelor of Science in symbolic systems and an Master of Science in computer science, with a specialization in artificial intelligence. But it was perhaps her research internships at SRI International in Menlo Park, California, and the UBS research lab in Zurich that helped her net 14 job offers fresh out of grad school.

                                Satya Narayana Nadella is an India-born American business executive. He is the current chief executive officer (CEO) of Microsoft.  He was appointed as CEO on 4 February 2014, succeeding Steve Ballmer. Before becoming CEO of Microsoft, he was Executive Vice President of Microsoft's Cloud and Enterprise group, responsible for building and running the company's Computing Platforms, Developer Tools and Cloud Computing Services.
                                Nadella attended the Hyderabad Public School, Begumpet before attaining a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering from the Manipal Institute of Technology in 1988 (then affiliated with Mangalore University), Manipal, Karnataka.

                                Nadella subsequently traveled to the U.S. to study for an M.S. degree in Computer Science at the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee, receiving his degree in 1990. Later he received an MBA from the University of Chicago Booth School of Business.

                                Nadella said he "always wanted to build things". He knew that computer science was what he wanted to pursue, but that passion was at precocious stage while studying at Manipal University. "And so it [electrical engineering] was a great way for me to go discover what turned out to become a passion," he says.
