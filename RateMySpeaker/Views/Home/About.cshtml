                                Our goal in creating this website was to provide attendees of technology conferences more information about what they may expect
                                from the speakers at those events. Because tickets to these conferences can be very pricey, our group saw an opportunity to help
                                provide fellow technology industry people with firsthand information from others who have attended events and can now have an avenue
                                to share their feedback. <br/>

                                        Despite this late start, Megan hasn't looked back since and currently works as an IT Infrastructure Engineer intern at Louisville Gas and Electric. She gets to learn about servers, routers, switches and other cool
                                        technology all day. When she isn't in school or working, Megan enjoys spending time with her loved ones and doing activities that allow her to get away from a
